# Docker
The server will be running on http://localhost. 

Run these commands to start the server:

    git clone git@github.com:patrick-melo/myipc.git
    cd myipc.io
    docker-compose up

## Development
To rebuild the sprites, you will need the M command (see above).

When the server is built, it copies the source files into the docker image.
To get the server to use the files in the repo instead, do the following

1. Uncomment the following lines  in `docker-compose.yml`:

        volumes:
            - .:/usr/app

            START_COMMAND: "sleep 999999999"

2. Restart the container (`docker-compose up`)

3. Run the following command to initialize react outside the container.

    m init web

4. Comment the following line in docker-compose.yml

            START_COMMAND: "sleep 999999999"

2. Restart the container (`docker-compose up`)

# Unit tests
Run the following command to run all unit tests:

    npm test

Run the following command to run a specific test file:

    npm test psql.test.js

# M command
You can add an alias to the following to ~/.zshrc.
You will need to start a new terminal window for the changes to take effect.

    alias m=~/eclipse-workspace/myipc.io/bin/m.sh

# Postgres
To rebuild the postgres database, you will need the M command (see above).
This will cause sprites.tgz to be rebuilt but it should be identical.

Run the following command to rebuild the sprites:

    m init postgres

# Shells

Run the following command to start a shell in the web container:

    m bash web

Run the following command to start a shell in the postgres container:

    m bash postgres

Run the following command to start a pgsql shell:

    m psql
